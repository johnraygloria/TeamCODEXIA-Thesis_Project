This is a notes for Ultrasound Pregnancy Wheel..

Code number 1.1:
In this code, I added a separate state USDate for the ultrasound date and a separate calendar for it. 
I also added separate states showLmpCalendar and showUsCalendar to control the visibility of the LMP and ultrasound calendars, 
respectively. When you click on “Ultrasound Date”, it will show the ultrasound calendar and hide the LMP calendar, and vice versa. 
The useEffect that listens to changes in USweeks and USdays now also listens to changes in USDate and LMP. 
It calculates the ultrasound date based on the selected ultrasound date (USDate) and checks if the difference between the 
ultrasound date and the LMP date is more than 5 days. If it is, it updates the LMP state. This will trigger the first 
useEffect to recalculate the dates for the 2nd and 3rd trimesters and the estimated due date. 
Please replace your existing code with this updated code. Let me know if you need further assistance.
